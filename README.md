# Shooting Methods Intro Project

Some small intro projects to get familiar with using shooting methods in power systes.

## References
Papers about shooting methods.

## Aprille Ex 1
The first project here is an implementation of example 1 from the paper by Aprille and Trick. It is a simple power supply rectifier circuit, implemented in MATLAB.
The main file is ```shooting_methods_example.m```.
A similar circuit in LTSPice for Mac is also included, which yields similar results to those reported in the paper, with small differences I would guess are due to the diode model.
